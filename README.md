  <h1> About Me! </h1>
<body> 
  <p> Hello all! My name is Lleyton Leonard and welcome to my notebook. I am a 4th year computer science student from Stone Mountain, Georgia. I enjoy reading, running, playing video games, and 3D modeling in Unity/Blender. Through this course I hope gain more practical coding experience in Java and broaden my skillset.  </p>
